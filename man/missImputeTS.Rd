\title{nonparametric missing value imputation by kalman smoothing, state space models and randomForest

This R script contains the actual missImputeTS function.}
\usage{
missImputeTS(
  xmis,
  maxiter = 10,
  ntree = 100,
  variablewise = FALSE,
  decreasing = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE,
  mtry = floor(sqrt(ncol(xmis))),
  replace = TRUE,
  classwt = NULL,
  cutoff = NULL,
  strata = NULL,
  sampsize = NULL,
  nodesize = NULL,
  maxnodes = NULL,
  xtrue = NA,
  parallelize = c("no", "variables", "forests"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{xmis}{= data matrix with missing values}

\item{maxiter}{= stop after how many iterations (default = 10)}

\item{ntree}{= how many trees are grown in the forest (default =100)}

\item{mtry}{= number of variables randomly sampled at each split. This argument is directly supplied to the 'randomForest' function. default value is sqrt(p) where p is the number of variables in 'xmis'.}
}
\description{
Uses Kalman Smoothing on structural time series models and missForest for imputation.missImputeTS' is used to impute missing values, especially for mixed type time series data. It can be used to impute continuous and/or categorical data, including complex interactions and non-linear relationships. This yields an out-of-bag (OOB) imputation error estimate. You can also save computation time by running them in parallel.
