Description: The function 'missImputeTS' in this package is used to 
        impute timeseries missing values particularly in the case of mixed-type
        data.It uses a random forest trained on the observed values of 
        a data matrix to predict the missing values. It can be used to
        impute continuous and/or categorical data including complex
        interactions and non-linear relations. It can be run in parallel to 
        save computation time.
