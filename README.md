# missImputeTS
Uses Kalman Smoothing on structural time series models and missForest for imputation.missImputeTS' is used to impute missing values, especially for mixed type time series data. It can be used to impute continuous and/or categorical data, including complex interactions and non-linear relationships. This yields an out-of-bag (OOB) imputation error estimate. You can also save computation time by running them in parallel.
