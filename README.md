# missImputeTS

 The missImputeTS package specializes on (multivariate) time series imputation. This algorithm is a combination of missForest and imputeTS algorithms. The missforest algorithm sometimes had a problem of presenting a bouncing value, and imputeTS had the disadvantage of being vulnerable to long-term missing and a univariate algorithm.
